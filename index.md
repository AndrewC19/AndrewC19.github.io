# About Me
I am a PhD candidate from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield, supervised by Dr Neil Walkinshaw. You can find out more about my previous education and employment on my LinkedIn profile.

#### Research
My main research interests include software testing, computational models (particularly agent-based), and causal inference. My current research focusses on leveraging causal inference techniques to support various testing activities in the context of computational modelling.

Aside from my core research, I am also interested in data visualisation and enjoy finding creative ways to communicate complex data and statistics.

#### Teaching
I been a graduate teaching assistant (GTA) on the following Computer Science courses:
- [COM2107 Logic in Computer Science](http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/modules/level2/com2107.html). For this module, I ran seminar sessions with groups of up to 70 students, covering topics such as propositional and predicate logic, natural deduction, and modal and temporal logic for verification.

- [COM3523 Software Re-engineering](http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/modules/level3/com3523.html). For this module, I helped students to reverse-engineer and appraise large, complex systems in Java using a variety of source code and execution analysis techniques (static and dynamic).

- [COM4506 Testing and Verification in Safety-Critical Systems](http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/modules/level4/com4506.html). For this module, I helped students to analyse software safety in safety-critical systems and implement a range of advanced software testing techniques, such as metamorphic testing.

 

#### Technology
I mainly develop in Python and Java, but have experience with a range of programming languages and technologies including, but not limited to:
